# Minecraft-OG-popular-name-picker-bot
Using selenium python module to set OG popular Minecraft names (Bot). The rise of Minecraft popularity, people pay 3rd parties to get super popular OG minecraft names that only release at a specific time. Using selenium I emulated the same effect, but for free :)

Edit the python file to set your minecraft username, password, and desired minecraft OG name. Bot will automatically login, set the desired name, spam the set profile name button so you are almost guaranteed to get the desired OG minecraft name. Does not send passwords or usernames.
